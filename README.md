# Coin
A program for converting currencies

# Usage
1. You can launch the program by typing `python coin.py`
2. (Linux only) Or you could `chmod +x coin.py` and create a softlink to the program in your PATH.  
Also use `coin -h` for the help menu. A man page is coming soon.

# Further information
Currently only Unix based systems are supported but support for Windows is coming soon. There might even be a GUI. The support for API keys is not yet available as it introduced complications. I will implement it eventually if there's a strong userbase.   
I wanted to mention this was made possible by the wonderful API created by Manuel "Manny" Vergel on https://currencyconverterapi.com

I was trying to learn libraries I never used before. And I learned some stuff in the process. 

# Oh look! A bug!
Please open an issue in case you found a bug.
